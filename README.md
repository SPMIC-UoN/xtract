## XTRACT - a command-line tool for automated tractography

XTRACT can be used to automatically extract a set of carefully dissected tracts in humans and macaques (other
species to come). It can also be used to define one's own tractography protocols where all the user needs to do is to
define a set of masks in standard space (e.g. MNI152).

The script was written by Shaun Warrington, Saad Jbabdi & Stamatios Sotiropoulos
(based on the autoPtx tool by Marius de Groot - see https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/AutoPtx)

The HUMAN and MACAQUE tractography protocols were created by:
